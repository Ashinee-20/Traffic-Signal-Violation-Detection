# Traffic-Signal-Violation-Detection
This project aims to detect the vehicles that violates the traffic signal. The dataset of vehicles is collected and detected using Yolo v3 from a set of images from input_images folder and stored in an output_image folder. The vehicles violating the traffic signals are collected from violating images folder where we scan the region of violation, if the vehicle falls in that region then it is detected using Yolo v3 and stored as an image in an output_violating_image folder. Finally the images from output_image folder and output_violating_image folder are matched using feature matching technique which is done by Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm. 
The accuracy was calculated by the difference in the pixels during feature matching  . The final accuracy was found to be around 75%
